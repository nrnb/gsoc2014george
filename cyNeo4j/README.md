CyNetLibSync
============

A Cytoscape app to connect to a Neo4j database and execute extensions of the Neo4j database.

For a roadmap see: ROADMAP.txt

A video demo is available at: http://youtu.be/XRRK4xtEM8s

The app is build against Cytoscape 3.0.1 and communicates with a Neo4j 2.0.0 instance.
The extension currently supported (shortestPath) has to be build from the Neo4j 2.0.1
source tree as the 2.0.0 implementation is bugged.
